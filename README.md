# **cGDM-Clinical-Genome-Data-Model**

The clinical Genome Data Model (cGDM) encompasses reliability-related factors that enable clinicians to access the reliability problem of each genomic test result as clinical evidence. 
The proposed cGDM could serve as a data-layer infrastructure supporting the intellectual interplay between medical experts and informed decision-making.

## Demo_Database
Two public data were imported into a cGDM-based database. This demo database is provided as an SQL statement executed by MySQL.
The provided two demo databases were created based on the following two public data:
1. [TCGA Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma(PAAD)](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-PAAD)
2. [1000 Genome Phase 3](https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/phase-3/)
	- In 1KGP3, only the sample data corresponding to the population code "CEU" ("Utah Residents with Northern and Western European Ancestry") were used.
    - The volume of this data is so large that it cannot be shared with github but through our server. - see the [Demo_Database/1000 Genome Phase 3 dataset](http://cipher.snubi.org:8800/github/cGDM_1KGP3_test_Dump.sql)
